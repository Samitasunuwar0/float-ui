            <p><h2>Leaves</h2>Leaves are highly efficient solar energy converters. They capture light energy and through the 
              process of photosynthesis. They are able to trap energy in the form of sugar molecules that are constructed 
              from carbon dioxide and water (both found in the atmosphere). All the energy required by living organisms 
              is ultimately dependent upon photosynthesis. Leaves are able to twist on their petioles, stalks, in order
               to maximize sun exposure and photosynthetic activity. </p>
